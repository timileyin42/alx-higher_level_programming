# my last project on data structures in python

# Description
What you are going to see & learn from this project:

Why Python programming is awesome (donâ€™t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
What are set and how to use them
What are the most common methods of set and how to use them
When to use sets versus lists
How to iterate into a set
What are dictionary and how to use them
When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
What is a key in a dictionary
How to iterate into a dictionary
What is a lambda function
What is map, reduce and map functions

# Squared simple
Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
# Search and replace
Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
# Unique addition
Write a function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer).
# Present in both
Write a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.
# Only differents
Write a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.
# Number of keys
Write a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.
# Print sorted dictionary
Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.
# Update dictionary
Write a function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.
# Simple delete by key
Write a function that deletes a key in a dictionary.
# Multiply by 2
Write a function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2
# Best score
Write a function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.
# Multiply by using map
Write a function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops.
# Roman to Integer
Technical interview preparation:
# Weighted average!
Write a function that returns the weighted average of all integers tuple (, )
# Squared by using map
Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix using map
# Delete by value
Write a function that deletes keys with a specific value in a dictionary.
# CPython #1: PyBytesObject
Create two C functions that print some basic info about Python lists and Python bytes objects.
